Election Audit Summary
The Colorado Board of Elections can use this script for any of their elections with just a few modifications. You can adjust the script to determine which had the lowest county voter turnout by changing largest_county_turnout to smallest_county_turnout. Another modification to determine the losing candidate's voting percentage is to change the winning_percentage to the losing_percentage.
